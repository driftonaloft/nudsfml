/*--+{ NuDSFML 2.5.1 }+------------------------------------------------------*\
| NuDSFML 2.5.1 (new DSFML) is a refactor of DSFML 2.4 by Jeremy Dahaan       |
| it has been refactored to be based on CSFML 2.5.1 via the bindbc.sfml       |
| library by Drifton Aloft                                                    |
|                                                                             |
| Caution not all current DSFML features have been replicated / implimented   |
| yet. use at your own risk this software probably contains bugs, clever      |
| fixes and other programmer hijinks                                          |
